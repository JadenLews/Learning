# Physics Informed neural Networks
* Universal function approximator
* Can embed knowledge of phycial laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process
* Can be described by partial idfferential equations (PDEs)
* Prior knowledge of general physical laws acris in the training of NN as a regularization agent that limits the space of admissible solutions, increasing the generalizabiltiy of the function approximation
* Embedding prior information into a NN results in enhancing information content of available data.
* Allows the learning algorithm to capture right solution and generalize well with low amount of training examples.
* For they process continious spacial and time coordinates and outputs continious PDE solutions, the can be categorized as neural fields.
