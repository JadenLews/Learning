# Physics Informed Deep learning (Part I): Data Driven solutions of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations

## Abstract
* NN that trained to solve supervised tasks while respecting any given law of physics described by general linlinear partial differential equations.
* Two distict classes of algorithms:
  * Continious time
  * Discrete Time
* Form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators

## Intro
* there exists a vast amt of prior knowledge in the principled physical laws that govern the time-dependent dynamics of a system
* Prior information can act as a regularization agent that constrains the space of admissible solutions to a manageable size
* Can direcrly tackle nonlinear problems wihtout the need for committing to any prior assumptions, linearization, or local time-stepping
